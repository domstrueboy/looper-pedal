//! The audio devices an app can open, and nothing about what it plays
//! through them.
//!
//! This crate knows about devices, formats and callbacks; it has never
//! heard of loops, layers or takes. That is the whole point of it being
//! separate: porting to another operating system means writing a
//! `AudioBackend` here, not touching anything that decides what the app
//! does.
//!
//! Samples cross this boundary as `f32` with full scale at +/-1.0,
//! whatever the device's own format is. Converting is the backend's job,
//! so no format assumption reaches the code above.
