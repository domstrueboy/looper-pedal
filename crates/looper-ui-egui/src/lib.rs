//! A leaf: each screen reads a model and returns an `Action`, and the
//! only way it reaches the rest of the app is by being called. Nothing
//! here decides anything - which is what makes swapping toolkit, or
//! adding a second look, a matter of writing another crate beside this
//! one rather than touching what the app does.
//!
//! `egui` appears here and nowhere else in the workspace.
